Introduction

Corner detection is a method used in computer vision systems to extract certain features of an image. Corner detection is used frequently in video tracking, stitching motion detection and object recognition. Corner detection overlaps with the topic of interest point detection. Harris corner detection to stitch two different images together. It picks corners because, since it is the intersection of two edges, it represents a point in which the directions of these two edges change. The gradient of the image (in both directions) have a high variation, which can be used to detect it
